EEG Brain Data Classification â€“ GSoC Project

This project performs classification of brain EEG signals to identify neural/metabolic states using traditional ML models. It includes data analysis, model training, evaluation, and feature selection.


The dataset contains 64-channel EEG recordings with band power features in theta, delta, alpha, beta, and gamma ranges. Two output classes are provided.
